# CS50 - Harvard University -EdX

The course introduces modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. This course is not only theory but also hands-on projects and experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course also offers the opportunity to come up with my own app. 

### My Goal is to learn and apply the best programming practices taught in this course to real world and or other projects of mine.
